You are using a proportion of Invariable sites estimate, although I don't
like it. The likelihood epsilon "-f e" will be automatically lowered to 0.001
to avoid unfavorable effects caused by simultaneous optimization of alpha and P-Invar


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences HOUSE4222-14818-FEMALE_SAMPLED_44.4444874416696 and HOUSE404-388-MALE_SAMPLED_44.9256747375452 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file ../sequences/Vill_04_Feb2015_5yr_pol.fas.reduced
