You are using a proportion of Invariable sites estimate, although I don't
like it. The likelihood epsilon "-f e" will be automatically lowered to 0.001
to avoid unfavorable effects caused by simultaneous optimization of alpha and P-Invar


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences HOUSE2668-14609-MALE_SAMPLED_42.4747359741856 and HOUSE2668-15546-FEMALE_SAMPLED_42.1827978098365 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file Vill_04_Feb2015_5yr_gag.muscle.phy.reduced
