You are using a proportion of Invariable sites estimate, although I don't
like it. The likelihood epsilon "-f e" will be automatically lowered to 0.001
to avoid unfavorable effects caused by simultaneous optimization of alpha and P-Invar


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences HOUSE307-11802-FEMALE_SAMPLED_44.7234066255922 and HOUSE5822-5800-MALE_SAMPLED_44.9046154567636 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file Vill_01_Feb2015_5yr_gag.muscle.phy.reduced
